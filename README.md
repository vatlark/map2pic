# map2pic

use this code to turn maps from here:
terrain maps from here: https://viewer.nationalmap.gov/basic/#startUp
into pictures

map2pic.py developed with the help of:
http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/71128/reading-national-elevation-dataset-arcgrid-gridfloat-img-with-python-only-tool/217122#217122
and
https://github.com/kjordahl/SciPy2013/blob/master/examples/kauai.py

The problem with kauai.py was is didnt handle voids well and it couldn't handle large files. Both of these issues have been resolved in map2pic.py

installing the GDAL package took me 2 days. good luck.
